# Ascii-To-C
Python program to turn Ascii Art text into C++ print statements

HOW TO USE:

1) Generate text in https://patorjk.com/software/taag/ (may work with other websites)
2) Copy and paste in asciiInput.txt (it already contains an example)
3) Execute main.py
4) Result will be stored in asciiOutput.txt, ready to be printed in C++

Features:
  * Adds cout<< at the beginning, \n; at the end, and puts the text between quotation marks.
  * Changes all the backslashes (\) to double backslashes (\\) for escaping the character so it can be printed OK.
